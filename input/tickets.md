# Party Planning Tickets 🎊

## Ticket 1: Start the Party! 🎈
Create the initial timestamped party script (`<day>-<time>-party.sh` as specified) with:
- Shebang line
- A welcome banner using colors
- Add: `echo -e "\033[1;35m🎉 Agent 1 arrives with balloons! 🎈\033[0m"`
- Add a 1-second sleep for dramatic effect
- Make the script executable with chmod +x

## Ticket 2: Bring the Music! 🎵
Append to the existing timestamped party script:
- Find the `<day>-<time>-party.sh` file created by Agent 1
- Add: `echo -e "\033[1;36m🎵 Agent 2 starts the music! 🎶\033[0m"`
- Add: `echo "  ♪ ♫ ♪ ♫ ♪ ♫"`
- Add another 1-second sleep

## Ticket 3: Grand Finale! 🎆
Complete the timestamped party script:
- Find the `<day>-<time>-party.sh` file that previous agents worked on
- Add: `echo -e "\033[1;33m🎆 Agent 3 brings fireworks! 🎇\033[0m"`
- Add: `echo -e "\033[1;32m🎊 ALL AGENTS: Party complete! What a celebration! 🎊\033[0m"`
- Make sure the script ends with a festive message
